Demonstrate understanding by making well reasoned design choices, and explaining any result
you obtain in straightforward, short, text. Remember, there isn't always one particular right
answer to how to do something, but you must justify what you did and demonstrate how it
worked.
Experiment with how to use different methods of feature extraction, parameter tuning, anal-
ysis and visualization to improve the performance of your model and your understanding of
its results.
